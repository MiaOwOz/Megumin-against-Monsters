# Megumin against Monsters

This is a little game, more like a graphical but more expanded version of my first project, **Magician against Monsters**. This time, it's a graphical game written using the Unity Engine.

## Features
Since the game is still in a very early alpha-state, there aren't much features:
> Half-functional Main Menu (Start, Options and Quit Button)

> Start-Button is functional as well as Quit

> Options currently does work.

> Ingame-Menu with 4 Buttons (Attack, Item, Flee, Magic)

## Installation
_Pre-built binaries_
Go to the releases tab and download the latest version of the game. Then extract the downloaded archive and open the .exe-file.

_Building it yourself_
Clone the repository and extract it onto your computer.
Then open the Unity-Project using atleast Unity Version `2020.3.8f1`.
In Unity, press `File -> Build Settings` if you want to change some settings, otherwise use `File -> Build and Run` to build the game without changing any settings.

## TODO / Planned Ideas
> Attacking

> Magic-Attack

> Items (Healing, etc.)

> Escaping

> Gacha (Skins, Items, Characters(?), etc.)

> An actual, playable world
