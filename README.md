# Megumin-against-Monsters

This is a little game, more like a graphical but more expanded version of my first project, **Magician against Monsters**. This time, it's a graphical game written using the Unity Engine.

## Features
Since the game is still in a very early alpha-state, there aren't much features:
> Half-functional Main Menu (Start, Options and Quit Button)
> Start-Button is functional as well as Quit
> Options currently does work.

> Ingame-Menu with 4 Buttons (Attack, Item, Flee, Magic)

## TODO / Planned Ideas
> Attacking
> Magic-Attack
> Items (Healing, etc.)
> Escaping
> Gacha (Skins, Items, Characters(?), etc.)
> An actual, playable world
